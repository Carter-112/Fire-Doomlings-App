    <h2>Overview</h2>
    <p>This Privacy Policy describes how the Doomlings App handles your information. We are committed to protecting your privacy and want to be clear that we do not collect or share any personal information.</p>

    <h2>Information Collection</h2>
    <p>We do not collect any personal information from our users. The app functions entirely locally on your device.</p>

    <h2>Advertising ID and Device Identifiers</h2>
    <p>Our app does not use or collect advertising IDs (such as Google's advertising ID on Android or Apple's IDFA). We do not implement any advertising features or tracking mechanisms that would require access to device identifiers.</p>

    <h2>Android 13+ Compliance</h2>
    <p>For users on Android 13 or later versions: This app does not use the advertising ID or any similar tracking identifiers. We have explicitly opted out of advertising ID collection and usage in compliance with Android platform requirements.</p>

    <h2>Information Sharing</h2>
    <p>Since we do not collect any information, we do not share any personal data with third parties.</p>

    <h2>Data Storage</h2>
    <p>Any game data or preferences are stored locally on your device and are not transmitted to any external servers.</p>

    <h2>Changes to This Policy</h2>
    <p>We may update this privacy policy from time to time. We will notify users of any changes by updating the "Last updated" date at the top of this policy.</p>
